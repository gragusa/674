\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Appendix A: List of Authors}

The following is a list of the contributors to the Econometrics Free
Library Project's \textit{Notes on Macroeconometrics}, in order of
their date of first involvement (yes, I'm aware that it's a little
ridiculous to have this as a separate file when there is only a single
contributor, but let's dream big, shall we).
