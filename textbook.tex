\section{A quick comment about these notes}
This text started as a set of lecture notes that Gray Calhoun wrote to
himself to teach half of a semester-long Macroeconometrics PhD
elective at Iowa State in 2013.  He (I) had no plans to disseminate
them until the course was over.  As a first step, the notes have been
converted to a \XeLaTeX\ document, but there is a lot of work left
before they would be useful to anyone trying to learn this material.
