A free graduate Macroeconometrics textbook
==========================================

The goal of this project is to produce and maintain as a community a
free textbook/research monograph on Macroeconometrics suitable for
teaching a PhD elective and make it available through the [GNU Free
Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).

There are a few reasons to do this. Perhaps the most important is that
there aren't appropriate textbooks for these classes: as far as I
know, Hamilton's *Time Series Analysis* is the most recent
comprehensive Econometric time-series book, but it was written in 1994
and doesn't cover many important recent developments.

The project is just getting started and is in version 0.0.0
(pre-alpha). Use at your own risk!
