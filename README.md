Free graduate Macroeconometrics lecture notes
=============================================

The goal of this project is to produce and maintain as a community a
free set of lecture notes on Macroeconometrics suitable for teaching a
PhD elective and make it available through the [GNU Free Documentation
License][FDL].

There are a few reasons to do this. Perhaps the most important is that
there aren't appropriate textbooks for these classes: as far as I
know, Hamilton's *Time Series Analysis* is the most recent
comprehensive Econometric time-series book, but it was written in 1994
and doesn't cover many important recent developments.

The project is in early development, version 0.2.4 (pre-alpha).  Use
at your own risk!

am not working on it very much right now, but will try to correct any
typos or other errors that are pointed out to me.

Dependencies and installation
-----------------------------

Either download a zip file from <https://github.com/grayclhn/674.git>
and extract the source or clone the git repo.

To build the pdfs, you'll need latexmk. The pdf can be generated by
typing
```
make
```
in the main directory.  Running
```
make clean
```
will clean up most of the files that LaTeX created in the first step
and
```
make burn
```
will delete them all, including the pdfs.

Thanks!
