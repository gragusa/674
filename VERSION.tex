\date{Unknown date and version (see \texttt{README.md}
      or \texttt{VERSION.tex} for directions).}

% The year and version information are missing; you can get
% them by running 
% 
%     make ver
% 
% on the command line (which will replace this file and CITATION.bib
% with the correct information) or (if `make` is not installed) by
% editing the date macro and bibtex entry (in CITATION.bib) manually:
% 
%     git show -s --date=short --format=%cd | head -c 4
%
% will give you the date of the latest commit (and other log
% information) and 
%
%     git describe --tags
%
% will give you the version.
