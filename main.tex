This text started as a set of lecture notes that I, Gray Calhoun,
wrote to myself to teach half of a semester-long Macroeconometrics PhD
elective at Iowa State in 2013.  I had no plans to disseminate them
until the course was over.  As a first step, the notes have been
converted to a \LaTeX\ document, but there is a lot of work left
before they would be useful to anyone trying to learn this material.
