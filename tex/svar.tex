\section{Structural Vector Autoregressions}

\subsection{Forecasting with VARs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Textbook material: \citet[Chapter 20]{Gr12}
\item Review articles: \citet{Ki13}, \citet{Wa94},
\item Key papers: \citet{Si80}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quick: forecast from VAR(p)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Iterated forecasts
\item Direct forecasts
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Uncertainty}

\begin{itemize}
\item For matrices, spots where it breaks are less obvious and depend
  on the derivative of the AR coefficients.
\item Bootstrap also used (but suffers from some of the same problems
  as $\delta$-method)
\item grid bootstrap (Mikusheva 2012)
\item mostly get pointwise CIs
\end{itemize}

(Add material on Bayesian CIs too)

\subsection{Basic ideas for IRF}

AR and MA models that we discussed earlier are \emph{descriptive}
models, but don't necessarily have any economic content
\[\phi(L) y_t = \theta(L) e_t\]
describes the second moments of $y_t$; the usual concerns about
simultaneity apply here (and even more forcefully than usual).

\begin{itemize}
\item Interested in dynamics
\item Want to know, what happens to $y_{t+1}, y_{t+2},\dots, y_{t+h},\dots$
  given an exogenous change to $y_{1,t}$?
\item What is an exogenous change to $y_{1,t}$? Can it be isolated
  from changes to $y_{2,t}$, $y_{3,t}$, etc?
\item Monetary shock
\item Technology shock
\item Financial shock (credit\dots)
\item Oil price shock
\item UNANTICIPATED
\end{itemize}

Look at $MA(\infty)$ representation (assuming stationarity, etc) zero mean
for simplicity \[y_t = C(L) e_t\] where $C(L) = \phi(L)^{-1} \theta(L) e_t$

we want to transform/rotate $e_t$ so that we have ``structural''
shocks $u_t$,
\[u_t = V e_t\] typically $u_t$ is normalized so that
\[\var( u_t ) = I\] (uncorrelation is kind of the definition of a macro
shock) and we have
\[y_t = C(L) V^{-1} u_t\ (rewrite\ as)\ B(L) u_t\]

So then
\[y_t = B_0 u_t + B_1 u_{t-1} + B_2 u_{t-2} + \cdots\]
and the effect of
\begin{itemize}
\item $u_{1t}$ shock to $y_t$ is $B_0 (1 0 0 \dots 0)$
\item $u_{1t}$ shock to $y_{t+1}$ is $B_1 (1 0 0 \dots 0)'$
\item etc.
\item $u_{1t}$ shock to $y_{t+k}$ is $B_k (1 0 0 \dots 0)'$
\end{itemize}
notice that $V$ is not identified and so the shocks are not identified:
if $W$ is any orthonormal matrix, so that $W W' = I$, then $W u_t$ has
variance $I$ as well, and
\[C(L) e_t = C(L) V^{-1} u_t = C(L) (VW)^{-1} ( W u_t )\]

\subsubsection{VAR representation}

(mention rank conditions)

\[B(L)^{-1} = A(L);\]
\begin{itemize}
\item structural form: $A_0 y_t = A_1 y_{t-1} + \cdots + A_p y_{t-p} + u_t$
\item reduced form: $y_t = A_0^{-1} A_1 y_{t-1} + \cdots + A_0^{-1} A_p
  y_{t-p} + A_0^{-1} u_t$
\end{itemize}
in this notation, the effect of
\begin{itemize}
\item $u_{1t}$ shock to $y_t$ is $A_0^{-1} (1 0 \dots 0)'$
\item $u_{1t}$ shock to $y_{t+1}$ is $A_0^{-1} A_1 × shocked\ y_t =
  A_0^{-1} A_1 A_0^{-1} (1 0 \dots 0)'$
\item $u_{1t}$ shock to $y_{t+2} = A_0^{-1} A_1 × shocked\ y_{t+1} +
  A_0^{-1} A_2 × shocked\ y_t = (A_0^{-1} A_1) × (A_0^{-1} A_1)
  A_0^{-1} (1 0 \cdots 0)'$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $(A_0^{-1} A_2) * A_0^{-1} (1 0 \cdots 0)'$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
etc (these formulas are really easy if you use the canonical form of
the VAR)

\begin{itemize}
\item With OLS, we can consistently estimate $A_0^{-1} A_1$, $A_0^{-1}
  A_2$, etc and $A_0^{-1} A_0^{-1\prime}$ (i.e. the variance-covariance
  matrix of the reduced form error).
\item BUT, we actually need to know \emph{all} of the elements of
  $A_0$ or $A_0^{-1}$, and $A_0^{-1} A_0^{-1\prime}$ is positive definite
  and so has only $n (n-1) / 2$ unique elements, not the $n^2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identification}

\begin{itemize}
\item Short run identification: Constrain $A_0$ or $A_0^{-1}$, not
  $(A_0^{-1} A_i)$.
\item that would be the typical simultaneous equations approach, IV,
  etc
\item Long-run identification (we'll discuss in a bit) -- based on the
  idea that some shocks (productivity shocks for example) permanently
  affect the level of some variables (per-capita output, for example)
\item Partial identification
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Short-run identification}

Suppose we know that
\begin{itemize}
\item $y_{1t}$ ignores $u_{2t}$ through $u_{nt}$
\item $y_{2t}$ ignores $u_{3t}$ through $u_{nt}$
\item dot dot dot
\item $y_{n-1,t}$ ignores $u_{nt}$
\item $y_{n,t}$ responds to all of the shocks
\end{itemize}
Then you know that $A_0^{-1}$ is lower triangular and so it's
identified.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sounds sort of ridiculous, but this was Sims's (1980) first
  identification approach;
\item You could imagine that the Federal Reserve sees what's happened
  in the economy before acting, so it would be at the bottom; $u_{nt}$
  would represent a monetary policy shock (the equation for $y_{nt}$
  would be something like a Taylor rule and $y_{nt}$ needs to be an
  interest rate).
\item ie imagine inflation, unemployment, and interest rates
\item probably want to leave the other coefficients of the interest
  rate equation unspecified so that you're allowing it to be forward
  looking (or include additional forward looking variables)
\item could specify
  \begin{equation*}
    R_t = R^* + coef * (inflation_t - inflation^*) + coef * (unemp_t - unemp^*) + coefs *
    R_{t-1} + \cdots + e_{Rt}
  \end{equation*}
\item but now this equation needs to be right (if it is, another
  source of identification)
\item This has the ``advantage'' of being especially easy to calculate
  (comes from a Choleski decomposition of the sample covariance
  matrix).
\item This is kind of old-fashioned; you can't usually identify every
  shock this way;
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{semi-structural}
\[y_t = (\Delta  gdp_t,\ inflation_t,\ fed\ funds_t)\]
``identify'' with recursive structure:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Delta  gdp_t$ only responds to
``first shock''
\item $inflation_t$ only responds to ``first shock'' and
``second shock''
\item $fed\ funds_t$ is set by monetary policy and responds
to everything
\item important thing is that it happens last
\item identify ``monetary policy shock'' as deviations from
  ``endogenous policy''
\item don't identify any other shocks (recursive structure for first
  two is really just a normalization device).
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item This could be more convincing with higher-frequency data (ie
  kalman filter/ state space models) or better policy knowledge
\item An argument that prices respond more quickly than quantities
  seems plausible overall (remembering that the VAR is supposed to be
  taking care of the endogenous component of both)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Kilian (2010) has other examples}

\begin{itemize}
\item Any economic argument to pin down particular values of
  $A_0^{-1}$ or $A_0$ can do the same trick.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Long-run identification}

Introduced in Blanchard and Quah (1989 AER)

\begin{itemize}
\item Their model: bivariate VAR ($\Delta  gdp_t$, $u_t$)
\item $\Delta  gdp_t$ is I(0)
\item Assume for argument's sake that $gdp_0 = 0$
\item Assumption: want to identify the shocks that have a long-run
  effect on $gdp_t$ (they argue that these have interpretation as a
  supply shock)
\item Start with structural MA representation:
\item $v_t$ consists of the policy shocks; first element is ``supply''
  shock
  \[( \Delta  gdp_t, u_t ) = C(L) e_t = D(L) v_t\]
  Simple rewrite:
  \[ \sum_{s=1}^t (\Delta  gdp_s, u_s) = D(L) \sum_s v_s \]
\item Apply the ``beveridge-nelson decomposition'' (note that $D(1) =
  D_0 + D_1 + \dots$
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{s=1}^t D(L) v_s
    &= \sum_{s=1}^t \sum_{j=0}^\infty D_j v_{s-j} \\
    &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty v_{t-j} \sum_{s=0}^j D_s \\
    &= (D(1) - \sum_{j=1}^\infty D_j) v_t + (D(1) - \sum_{j=2}^\infty D_j) v_{t-1} + \cdots \\
    &= D(1) \sum_{s=1}^t v_s + D^*(L) v_t
  \end{align*}
  where $D_k^* = - \sum_{j=k+1}^\infty D_j$ and
  $D(1) = \begin{pmatrix}
    D_{11}(1) & D_{12}(1) \\ D_{21}(1) & D_{22}(1)
  \end{pmatrix}$
\item This gets us $(gdp_t, \sum_{s=1}^t u_s) = sum = D(1) \sum_{s=1}^t v_s
  + D(L) v_t$
\item second part are purely transitory shocks
\item $D(1)$ part are the ``permanent shocks''
\item model makes no claim about permanent
  shock on summed unemployment
\item does make claim about shock on
  $gdp_t$
\item second element of $v_t$ can't have permanent effect, so
  $D_{12}(1)$ must be zero!
  \[vcv(v_s) = I vcv(C(1) e_t) = vcv(D(1) v_t),\]
  so
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $C(1) \Sigma C(1)`= D(1) D(1)'$ (and LHS can be estimated
    consistently);
  \item here $D(1)$ can be estimated as the choleski decomposition of
    estimated $C(1) \Sigma C(1)'$ (and know that, if we have the reduced
    form VAR model $\Phi(L) y_t = e_t$ then $\Phi(L)^{-1} = C(L)$ (and this
    holds for $L = 1$)
  \item So then $v_t = \hat D(1)^{-1} \hat C(1) e_t$ and $A_0^{-1} =
    \hat D(1)^{-1} \hat C(1)$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
